# SpriteSlicer
Custom Sprite Slicer  Unity has a very nice and easy to use sprite slicer that comes with the program. However, this slicer is limited due to the fact that it can't be accessed during the game in real time. Noah has coded a custom slicer in C# that's easy to use and slices real time.
